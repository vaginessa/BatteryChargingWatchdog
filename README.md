# BatteryChargingWatchdog
Android app that monitors your battery percentage while charging, notifies you on certain events and logs your charging behavior.

There exist theories that the lifespan of a lithium ion battery is expanded if it's only charged up to 80% or so instead of 100%.
This app helps you achieve that goal. You can define a custom battery percentage threshold. 
When reached the app will notify you to stop charging.
Same goes for lower threshold with "please start charging" notification (for instance on 20% battery).

In addition the app monitors your charging behavior. (will be added in a later version)
